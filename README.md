# Real-Time-Face-Emotion-Detection
<h1>Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib </h1>
–	Built a real-time facial emotion detection system using CNN trained on FER2013 dataset.
–	Integrated OpenCV for face detection and real-time webcam feed with minimal latency.
–	Designed a multi-layer CNN with dropout layers for reduced overfitting, achieving ∼72% accuracy in live testing.
–	Optimized for lighting conditions and performance (15–20 FPS) on standard hardware.
–	Implemented model evaluation via accuracy metrics, confusion matrix, and visualizations.
